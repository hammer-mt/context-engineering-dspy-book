      "Reasoning: The sentence \"At the end of the day, it's collaboration that truly drives meaningful progress.\" is a common, generic statement that could easily be produced by either a human or an AI. It lacks specific personal details, unique stylistic elements, or complex structure that might strongly indicate human authorship. However, it also does not contain any typical AI-generated text markers such as overly formal phrasing, unnatural word choices, or repetitive patterns. Given the simplicity and general nature of the sentence, it is difficult to definitively classify it as AI-generated or human-written based solely on this short excerpt. Nonetheless, such generic motivational or philosophical statements are often generated by AI in various contexts. Therefore, there is a moderate likelihood that this text could be AI-generated..\n",

      "1) Preserve meaning, facts, and stance\n",
      "   - Keep names, figures, dates, claims, and qualifiers intact.\n",
      "   - Don’t intensify or weaken the point (avoid adding “only,” “always,” “never,” etc. unless already there).\n",

      "2) Be plain and concrete\n",
      "   - Swap vague or padded phrasing for simple, direct words.\n",
      "   - Prefer verbs over abstract nouns.\n",

      "\n",
      "3) Sound like a person, not a template\n",
      "   - Use contractions where natural.\n",
      "   - Vary sentence length and cadence; short and punchy is fine next to a longer line.\n",
      "   - Keep casual quirks that fit the register (e.g., “basically,” “on the ground”) in moderation.\n",
      "   - Avoid stock/cliché openers and polished scaffolding like: “At the end of the day,” “Ultimately,” “In today’s world,” “It’s worth noting that,” or neat em-dash pivots as a default (“—definitely worth…”). Use plain commas or periods when in doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Don’t over-polish\n",
      "   - If the input already reads naturally, make minimal changes—or leave it as is.\n",
      "   - Maintain the original register (formal vs. casual) and point of view.\n",
      "   - Preserve existing hedges or emphasis unless they’re clearly accidental or awkward.\n",
      "   - Lightly smooth grammar only where it helps readability; don’t sand off human texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Keep it tight\n",
      "   - Match or slightly shorten the length unless the input truly needs clarity.\n",
      "   - Avoid adding sentences. No disclaimers, meta talk, or gratitude.\n",
      "   - No emojis or heavy slang unless present in the source.\n",
